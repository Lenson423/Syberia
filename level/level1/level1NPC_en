Greeting|Excuse me!|Sir! Please! Just a moment!|I am not deaf, you know!|I am sorry to disturb you in your work, Sir, but...|This young mammuthus primigenius is barely 40000 years old!\n Fantatsic, wouldn't you say, Miss?|Er... Yes... Probably.|What do you mean "probably"?|Err.... I don't know...|You don't know... You don't know... I see... What can I do for you, \nmy dear child?
Asks about Hans|To tell you the truth, I am looking for Mr Hans Voralberg. He is the \nsole heir of a very unusual factory. My company is in charge of \nnegotations for the takeover of this factory. At last word, he was\nliving in Siberia. So, as soon as my train is ready, I'll be\ncontinuing my journey eastwards.|Siberia! Ah! Siberia! But what was it you said again?|Said what?|You mentioned a name... The person you are looking for...|Voralberg. Hans Voralberg. Do you know him?|Hans Voralberg... How could I forget him! Such an extraordinary\nfellow. So inventive! We shared a passion for mammoths, you know, and\nwe bonded over this passion. Without it, I confess, I would have had\nlittle to do with an odd, ageless retard like Hans. At the time, we\nwere both students. Well, sort of. Put it this way: Hans had special\npermission to attend palaeontology lectures.|Your Hans Voralberg sounds uncannily like the one I'm looking for.|I'm not sure my dear. Hans was above all questions of money and business.\nJust to imagine him running a factory. Pfff! Perish the thought|Can you tell me a little bit more about him?|He was always a mystery to me. He never seemed to so very much and\nnever quite seemed to grasp what you said to him. He expressed \nhimself instead through his incredible mechanical contraptions. His \ninventions, I admit, have been much appreciated by the university. \nThe few times we really did talk, it was about his strange interest\nfor mammoths and a "doll", some sort of "doll" that obsessed him...| A doll, you say?|Yes. He kept talking about it. One day, he described it to me - A \nsort of children's toy. A miniature mammoth mounted by a mahout. It\nappears he found it in a cave not far from his home. The even all \nsounds very dramatic. His account was slightly confused but it awoke \na great interest in me!|What do you mean?|To my knowledge, there is only one tribe who made figurines featuring \na mahout and that tribe is the Youkols. They lived in the farthest\nreaches of Siberia, and for them, the dolls constituted a sacred \nobject, illustrating one of their central legends. How such a doll\nmade the journey from the frozen Siberian north to a cave in the \nFrench Alps is a mystery to me. Even today, it is beyond my  comprehension.|Have you considered that Hans Voralberg was maybe making it up? You \nsaid yourself that he didn't seem to have all his mental facilities intact.|No... That is impossible... Hans couldn't invent a story like that. \nThe doll is a sacred part of the Syberia legend. He described it to \nme in exact detail. Syberia, itself, is a chimera that \npalaeontologists of the world are very fond of pursuing.|I'll leave you in peace. I hope I haven't disturbed you too much.|Sorry? No... No! Not at all, dear child!
Sauvignon|If I were to say forest Sauvignon to you, what would you say?|Let's see... Sauvignon... Sauvignon... I would say that it is some \n|We are talking about the same plant then. It is a very rare shrub\nwith small juice fruits. I found a book about the Amerzone and it \nsays that there are even Sauvignon plants growing right here in\nBarrockstadt. You wouldn't know where, would you?|Hmmm... Amerzone Sauvignon plants, here? No... No... I don't think\n there are any. Highly implausible. But... You should ask the\nstationmaster. He is the keeper of the greenhouse at our university,\n so he could tell you more than me.|OK! Thanks very much. \nI'll leave you in peace. I hope I haven't disturbed you too much.|Sorry? No... No! Not at all, dear child!
