Greetings|Madame Romanski. Madame Helena Romanski?|Who are you? What do you want?|I am sorry to disturb you, Ma'am! My name's Kate Walker. I've come on \nbehalf of Franck Malkovitch.|Malkovitch! The old son of a gun... Are you one of his relatives?| Not exactly! He's a good friend of my mother's. He told me you might\nbe here, in Aralbad. I'm American, a lawyer!| To what do I owe your visit? You have come so far... It must be important!|Indeed, it is! I have very delicate and pressing business to attend to
Ask about Hans|I get the impression that Hans Voralberg turned up here too.|You know Hans Voralberg?|Not exactly! I'm looking for him to sort out this inheritance case. \nBut I've had to snoop around in his past a bit to get on his trail\nand I guess he's kind of a close friend now. You knew him, didn't you!|Aah! Yes! I knew Hans Voralberg! Do you hear James? Aah! If you had \nhad the chance to meet Hans... My Hans... Oh, my God... What has\nbecome of him? Where is he?|As questions go, Madame, that one is not without certain complications| I am sorry but I have no idea. That is the goal of my mission - to \nfind Hans Voralberg. That is why I have to get back to my train as\nquickly as possible and get it out of Komkolzgrad.|And you cannot find him without the train...|The train is one of his last inventions. So is Oscar, the automaton \nengineer. I get the feeling that the two of them are going to lead me to him|Did you hear that James? I might see Hans again! I have dreamed so \nlong of meeting my dearest sweetheart again. Oh if only I could \nsing... If only I were in Paris... I would ask George for that \nmiracle coctail, the one that only he knew how to make...|I don't understand.| An extraordinary tale, my dear! It was December and it was terribly \ncold and damp. I had to play the role of Tatiana that evening at \nthe opera. But since that morning I had lost my voice. It drove me \ncompletely mad with worry. I don't know how George, the barman at\nthe Meuritz Hotel, heard about my affliction but he brought me up a\ncocktail that he had invented. A strange concoction. But it turned \nout to be a miracle cure! My voice returned to me in an instant!|That's amazing! That's just what we need! We're going to mix you up a cocktail|Aah! My dear child... It is impossible. George never told me the \n recipe of the drink. He loved to keep his trade secrets. He said it \nmade him absolutely irreplaceable.|Well, I'm going to get George to tell me. He hasn't yet met with my \npowers of persuasion.\n I'll let you get a bit of rest. Thanks for listening to me like that!|It was a real pleasure, my child. You are a charming young lady and\nsimply talking to you has warmed my soul..
